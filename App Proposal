Research and Evidence

Technology in education can help close the education gap, especially in underserved areas, and support lifelong learning for careers (Springer, 2022).

The UNESCO GEM Report (2023) mentions that despite progress, issues like poor infrastructure and unequal access still exist, making digital solutions important.

Research on Sustainable Development Goal 8 (SDG 8) shows that the mismatch between education and job market needs affects youth employment. 

Digital platforms that offer skills training and mentoring can improve job opportunities and economic growth (Frontiers in Sociology, 2023; Eurostat, 2023).
